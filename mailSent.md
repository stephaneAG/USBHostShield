## follows, the mail I sent on 29/04/2020 to the author of the tutorial, hoping to get a 'correct' answer & to be proven wrong regarding the 'intellectual fraud' part ..

Hi !
I'm the author of the 'angry' comment on your website ( at the following address: https://www.learnrobotics.org/blog/control-arduino-robot-bluetooth-keyboard/ )
While I was quite upset reading it, despite some of the comments, & not having 'bang for my bucks', I'm still wondering why the page url, title & other misleading infos have not yet been fixed, or the tutorial updated to correspond to what its title says .. ( I'd have happily paid few more bucks to get the 'correct' tutorial .. )

.. but the thing I'm mostly interested in is getting the following setup working:HID bluetooth device with no dedicated usb dongle -> some hardware -> Arduino/uC
Re-reading one of the other people's comment, your reply to it seemed to imply you had knowledge on how to do so:( quoting your words: ".. If you don’t want to use the computer as the “bluetooth” device, you can pair the keyboard directly to your robot’s bluetooth module, and then map keyboard keys to movement functions."
I am indeed very much interested to doing so, and more precisely which hardware / software solution you had in mind ( or maybe you tested such implementation yourself, to be able to say so ? )
I'm currently digging how to setup the HC-05 & cie as 'master', but not sure if it supports slaves other than SPP ( and if I'm not wrong, we need HID slaves here .. ), reason for the present mail

I'd be very delighted to receive an answer from you on this ( I also revise my quite harsh opinion on this, since I'm 'no one to ~judge here' ( I'm no engineer nor teacher, only a self-taught hacker-wannabe .. )

Also, if you're indeed not an intellectual fraud or a scammy person, I'd very much appreciate ( & guess others would be too ) you revising your tutorial so that it doesn't pop in searches for such subject on the web: since your url is present in few webpages, it just wastes the time of anyone that's looking for an actual answer, which make me both sad & angry ( sad at 1st, and angry for the time taken to use 'alterpay', then subscribing, only to find .. that it's not waht I'm looking after )
-> I'd also happily update the repo I just initiated to reflect your behavior, if it's indeed erroneous but not willingly so ..
Now, and in the spirit of Stallman & alikes ( aka FREE knowledge & code .. ), if you follow the link below, you'll find code I wrote yesterday to use bluetooth HID devices ( with a dedicated usb dongle ) in combination with an USB Host Shield to actually control an Arduino using a bluetooth keyboard or mouse: I hope it 'll convince you on the reason I'm 'angry' & acting like so( also, I took the time to explain reasons of my anginess in its readme, as well as posting a link to your tutorial, hoping others 'll land on my page & find stuff they're actually looking for .. )

Looking forward to reading from you on this, and I guess depending on your answer I may want to digg the other tutorials your wrote ( maybe .. )
Thanks in advance for the time it took you to read the present mail, and for providing me hints on how to implement the setup you had in mind ( in the quote's blue test ), I whish we all find what we're looking after ..
